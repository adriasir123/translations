 \f[8]Middle-Aged Man
 "The atmosphere here feels way too murky.
  On top of that, it's quiet... too quiet."

@1
 \f[8]Middle-Aged Man
 "El ambiente aquí se siente demasiado turbio.
  Y como si esto fuera poco, hay silencio... mucho silencio."
  
@1
 \f[8]Middle-Aged Man
 "This isn't normal,
  especially with the situation we're in."

@1
 \f[8]Middle-Aged Man
 "Esto no es normal, sobre todo teniendo en cuenta la situación en la que nos encontramos."
  
@1
 \f[8]Middle-Aged Man
 "This underground passage should be packed with tons of
  evacuees."
  
@1
 \f[8]Middle-Aged Man
 "But I don't even hear a single damned footstep..."
 
@1
 \f[8]Middle-Aged Man
 "I don't like this, not one bit."
 
@1
 \f[8]Middle-Aged Man
 "No me gusta esto, ni un poco." 
 
@1
 \f[8]Shifty Guy
 "Hey, old man, am I really going to be okay out here?"
 
@1
 \f[8]Shifty Guy
 "I'm telling you right now -- if things go south,
  I'm taking you down with me. You got that?!"
  
@1
 \f[8]Middle-Aged Man
 "Tch. What you need to do right now is to shut your goddamned
   trap, you little shit."

@1
 \f[8]Middle-Aged Man
 "Sh. Lo que tienes que hacer ahora es cerrar el maldito pico, pequeño mierda."

 "Die? Me? Hahahah!
  Do you even hear what you're saying?!"
  
@1
 \f[8]Shifty Guy
 "Dementia hitting you hard, old man?
  Do I need to take you to a nursing home?"
  
@1
 \f[8]Middle-Aged Man
 "Ugh, just shut it, you dumb shit!"

@1
 \f[8]Middle-Aged Man
 "Uf, ¡cállate ya capullo!"
 
@1
 \f[8]Middle-Aged Man
 "Hey, girl. I'm going to make sure that you--and only you--make
  it to the Royal Capital in one piece."
  
@1
 \f[8]Middle-Aged Man
 "And you know what you can do for me once we get there?"
 
@1
 \f[8]Middle-Aged Man
 \c[4]"You can thank me properly in bed, if you know what I mean.
  Heh heh heh..."
  
@1
 \f[8]Shifty Guy
 "Great, now we got a disgusting old man on our hands...
  More like HE should have been the first to die."

@1
 \f[8]Is there something approaching from the other side?

@1
 \f[8]If that monster swallows you whole, it's all over.
 
@1
 \f[8]You need to retreat to another location where you can fight back.

 "Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-What do we do?!
  O-O-O-O-O-Old man, you got to do something!"

 "Do you want those spiders to notice us?!"
 
@1
 \f[8]Middle-Aged Man
 "Looks like we don't have a choice...
  Our only path is going further underground."
  
@1
 \f[8]Middle-Aged Man
 "Hey, girl! Follow me!"
 
@1
 \f[8]Shifty Guy
 "Aw, man...
  You mean to tell me that there's no other way to get there?!"
  
@1
 \f[8]Shifty Guy
 "This crap freaks me out."
 
@1
 \f[8]Shifty Guy
 "Hey, you. I was wondering about something."
 
@1
 \f[8]Shifty Guy
 "Do you have a name? Or is that too much to ask?"
 
@1
 \f[8]Shifty Guy
 "Come on, you can tell me."
 
@1
 \f[8]Shifty Guy
 "Hey, I'm asking you a question.
  Why don't you say something?"
  
@1
 \f[8]Shifty Guy
 "Do your ears work?
  Hello? Can you hear me?"
  
@15
 \f[8]Enri
 *sigh*
 
@1
 \f[8]Shifty Guy
 "Oh. So now you want to give me some attitude?
  Then that's how it is, huh?"
  
@1
 \f[8]Shifty Guy
 "Didn't think you'd be such a stuck-up broad."
 
@1
 \f[8]Shifty Guy
 "But I'll bet I'm not the first one to tell you that, huh?"
 
@1
 \f[8]Shifty Guy
 "Man, I pity you."
 
@1
 \f[8]Shifty Guy
 "It's a shame that someone pretty on the outside has to be ugly
  on the inside. And who would want to be around a person like
  that?"
  
@1
 \f[8]Shifty Guy
 "Do you get it?
  I'm calling you ugly because that's who you are!"
  
@1
 \f[8]Shifty Guy
 "Still with the attitude, huh?
  Heh... You're quite something alright."
  
@1
 \f[8]Shifty Guy
 "You're ugly, through and through!
  I feel sorry for you. Hahahahah!"
  
@1
 \f[8]Shifty Guy
 "You're not saying anything back because you know I'm right,
  huh?"
  
@1
 \f[8]Shifty Guy
 "Seriously? Come on!
  Nothing? No response at all?"
  
@1
 \f[8]Shifty Guy
 "You really are ugly -- better yet, a repulsive whore!
  Wow, I can't stop pitying you! Hahahah!"
  
@1
 \f[8]Shifty Guy
 "In the end, girls like you will grow up to be...
 
@1
 \f[8]Shifty Guy
 "...the type of woman who would shake her hips for disgusting
  men, just like the filthy whore you are!"
  
@1
 \f[8]Shifty Guy
 "Honestly, dregs of society like you would be better off dead."
 
@1
 \f[8]Shifty Guy
 "You know I'm only saying this for your benefit, right?"
 
@1
 \f[8]Shifty Guy
 "You see, I'm different than you;
  I have a big heart and I'm kind."
  
@1
 \f[8]Shifty Guy
 "I'm nowhere near being repulsive like y--"
 
@1
 \f[8]Shifty Guy
 "...Huh?"
 
@1
 \f[8]Shifty Guy
 "E-EEEK!!"
 
@1
 \f[8]Shifty Guy
 "M-MONSTER!
  STAY AWAY FROM ME!!"
  
@1
 \f[8]It looks like the hatch covering has been shut tight...
 
@1
 \f[8]You must go through the underground tunnel to move forward.

 "...?"
 
@1
 \f[8]There is something approaching from this direction.
 
@1
 \f[8]It'd be best to hurry.

---Underground Tunnel - 3---

@1
 \f[8]You need to retreat for now.
 
---Underground Tunnel - 4---

@1
 \f[8]The \c[12]demonic ax\c[10] suddenly vanishes!
 
@1
 \f[8]Until the \c[12]demonic ax\c[10] restores itself,
 you are unable to change into your demon form.
 
-------------------

@1
 \f[8]You shouldn't get too close to the fleshy mass engulfed by the
 flames.
 
---Underground Tunnel - 5---

@1
 \f[8]You don't stand a chance if you happen to encounter any more
 of those spider-like hellbeasts without being able to change into
 your demon form.
 
@1
 \f[8]You must proceed with caution.
